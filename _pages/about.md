I am a Quantitative Research Strategist in the ETrading team at Morgan Stanley. By nature, I am a mathematical guy, excited to explore and solve complex computational problems. My research work has mostly been in Machine Learning, focusing on Reinforcement Learning in Games, Semi Supervised Programming and Computer Vision to enhance user experience. I have also built scalable software applications involving Database Management and Frontend Support. On the systems side, I have successfully created C based compiler and contributed to understanding and tweaking XV6 operating system as a part of my course projects.

I am keen to apply fundamental and statistical machine learning in quantitative finance space. My future goal is to build efficient mathematical models for the same. My experience with Morgan Stanley has showcased that such models form the foundation of market making and hedging processes in sell side firms. Hence, enhancing them and implementing new models seems to be both thrilling and contributing. I believe that this vision can also be harnessed to structure something similar for the buy side institutions like hedge funds. I am confident of leveraging programming and analytical skills gained through my undergraduate program at IIT BOMBAY while clubbing it with enhanced ETrading knowledge base that I gained while being with Morgan Stanley. Further, I am optimistic that my research experience with professors from IIT BOMBAY, Indiana University and Scientists from Adobe Research will set up structure for impactful and sustainable RnD career ahead.

In my co curricular space, I love to play Badminton, Cricket, go trekking with friends, be close to nature and serve communities. I am people's man and would mostly choose to spend time with family, friends as opposed to watching series on Netflix.

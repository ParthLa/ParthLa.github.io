<p align="justify"> This project was with AYU DEVICES, a health-tech startup spun out of BETIC, IIT BOMBAY and supported by BIRAC, DBT-Government of India. It was utilized in building Indiaâ€™s first Indigenous Digital Stethoscope that can denoise the Heart and Lung sounds and amplify them up to 40X times making it very clear for the diagnosis of Heart murmurs and Lung abnormalities. </p>

<p align="justify"> This was the course work of Implementation of Programming Languages Lab at IIT BOMBAY, in Spring 2021. </p>

<p align="justify"> -> Created a C-like compiler from scratch using lex and yacc </p>
<p align="justify"> -> Implemented the scanning, parsing, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), Three Address Code (TAC) and Register Transfer Language (RTL) stages for input programs with visibility of output of each intermediate stage </p>
<p align="justify"> -> Input programs had assignments, functions, complex expressions and control flow structures </p>
<p align="justify"> -> Ensured that illegal tokens, syntax errors are semantic errors are efficiently reported </p>

<p align="justify"> This was the project of the course Database and Information Systems Lab at IIT BOMBAY, in Spring 2021.</p>

<p align="justify"> -> Created a GUI website application for a Restaurant Management System using ER Diagram and BCNF Normalization concepts with cookie based login authentication </p>
<p align="justify"> -> The application creates an ordering pipeline (placing an order, alloting to a chef, then served by a waiter) that simulates a real-world restaurant system </p>
<p align="justify"> -> A customer can view his/her order history, recommended dishes, filter dishes based on cuisine and budget and place an order, chef/waiter can view profile and complete orders alloted </p>
<p align="justify"> -> The owner can view and update inventory and employee information, allot orders to chefs/waiters and can view analytics and graphs on top dishes, top employees and statistics on profits, expenditure and wastage (Analytics filterable on date ranges) </p>
<p align="justify"> -> Employed PostgreSQL with PgAdmin4 to maintain Dynamic Database and NodeJS to link it with frontend </p>
<p align="justify"> -> Used MVC architecture in NodeJS (Express), PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, ChartJS, html2pdf.js </p>
